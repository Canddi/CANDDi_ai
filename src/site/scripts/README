All the scripts for a live or dev canddi instance (e.g. for daemons, NOT for tests) should go in here.
It should include things like:

CLI
Node
Rabbit
Etc.

Eventually make these into init scripts (although how they would work on mac is another matter).

TODO: Make a status script for each of these.
